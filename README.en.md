# SMSSimulator

#### Introduction
The External Stores Management Simulation System (SMSSimulator) is a simulation system designed for pilots operating fighter jets. It comprises four main modules: Display Control, Data Transmission, Navigation, and Weapon Interface. These modules facilitate communication and control of external stores, including missiles, bombs, rocket pods, external fuel tanks, and gun pods. Pilots utilize the Display Control System to operate weapons and receive feedback for further actions during combat.

#### Software Architecture
SMSSimulator is composed of six key modules:

1. Main Mode Control Module: Change the aircraft's control mode.
2. Navigation Control Module: Adjust the aircraft's latitude and longitude coordinates.
3. Weapon Launch Module: Set weapon launch types, unlock mounting point locks, specify electrical mounting points, and launch weapons.
4. External Stores Mounting Information Retrieval Module: Receive mounting information from the simulator.
5. Information Output Bar: Display relevant information.
6. Client List: Maintain a list of connected clients.
